# Milo Frontend

## How to run the server locally
The repository uses Vite JS for serving and bundling the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adithya31101/Milo-Frontend.git

npm install
npm run dev # to run development server
```

This should start a local server at localhost:3000. 

```bash
npm run build # Make sure there is the server folder in the same directory
```
